         <h3>Early 20C || Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>

         <p>
            &emsp;The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the
            world's knowledge and classify it according to a system called the Universal
            Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th century by
            Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been
            identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management,
            and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the Internet.

         <h3>
            1942 || Secret Communication System for “Frequency Hopping” , Hedy Lamarr and
            George Anthei
         </h3>
         <img
            src="images/communications.jpg"
            alt="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/hedy-lamarrs-wwii-invention-helped-shape-modern-tech"
            height="450" />
         <p>
            &emsp;Lamarr contributed the idea of frequency hopping, while Antheil drew on
            his experience with “Ballet Mécanique” and the sixteen player pianos to devise
            a means of synchronizing the rapidly changing radio frequencies envisioned by
            Lamarr. Their joint invention used a mechanism similar to piano player rolls
            to synchronize the changes between the 88 frequencies and called for a
            high-altitude observation plane to steer a radio-controlled torpedo from
            above. They submitted their patent on June 10, 1941, and the patent was
            granted on August 11, 1942.
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp;Years later, the US military turned to the concept of frequency hopping
            for the development of “sonobuoys” to help detect enemy submarines, and by the
            time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, American ships had torpedoes controlled by
            frequency-hopping systems. Now known more generally as “spread spectrum,” this
            type of technology is foundational for military communication technologies in
            addition to systems such as GPS, phone networks, and Wi-Fi.

         <h3>1960s || The Birth of the Internet, ARPANET</h3>

         <p>
            &emsp;The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first
            wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the
            first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both
            technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was
            established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United
            States Department of Defense.

         <h3>1989 || Invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
         <img
            src="images/WWW.jpg"
            alt="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web/short-history-web"
            height="300" />
         <p>
            &emsp;Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist invented the World Wide Web (WWW)
            in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed
            to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in
            universities and institutes around the world. He developed the first web
            server, the first web browser, and a document formatting protocol, called
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp; CERN is not an isolated laboratory, but rather the focal point for an
            extensive community that includes more than 17 000 scientists from over 100
            countries. Although they typically spend some time on the CERN site, the
            scientists usually work at universities and national laboratories in their
            home countries. Reliable communication tools are therefore essential.
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp;The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of
            computers, data networks and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global
            information system.

         <h3>1992 || ViolaWWW, Pei-Yuan Wei</h3>
         <img

         <p>
            &emsp;Released in 1992, Viola was the invention of Pei-Yuan Wei, a member of
            the Experimental Computing Facility (XCF) at the University of California,
            Berkeley. Viola was a UNIX-based programming/scripting language; the acronym
            stood for "Visually Interactive Object-oriented Language and Application".
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp;ViolaWWW is a discontinued web browser, the first to support scripting
            and stylesheets for the World Wide Web (WWW). It was first released in
            1991/1992 for Unix and acted as the recommended browser at CERN, where the WWW
            was invented, but eventually lost its position as most frequently used browser
            to Mosaic.

         <h3>1993 || NCSA Mosaic, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina</h3>
         <img
            src="images/mosaic.png"
            alt="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic"
            height="300" />
         <p>
            &emsp;NCSA Mosaic is a discontinued web browser that was instrumental in
            popularizing the World Wide Web and the general Internet during the 1990s.
            Although not the first web browser (preceded by WorldWideWeb, Erwise, and
            ViolaWWW),
            <b
               >it was the first browser to display images inline with text instead of a
               separate window.</b
            >
         </p>
         <p>
            &emsp;It supported various Internet protocols such as HTTP, FTP, NNTP, and
            Gopher. Its interface, reliability, personal computer support, and simple
            installation contributed to Mosaic's initial popularity.
