               JODI is a net art group consisting of Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans. The
               group was one of the first to use the Internet’s creative possibilities.
               Already around 1994 they were beginning to use the Internet as material.
               Jodi pioneered Web art in the mid-1990s. Jodi were among the first artists
               to investigate and subvert conventions of the Internet, computer programs
               and video and computer games.

               queers in love at the end of the world is a hypertext game built on the
               Twine platform in which the player experiences fleeting intimacy in a
               ten-second narrative. In the upper left of the browser window, a timer
               counting down the seconds prompts the reader to move quickly, advancing the
               narrative by clicking highlighted action words with little time to
               deliberate or savor the moments chosen before "Everything is wiped away."
               Anthropy writes of the work, "If you only had ten seconds left with your
               partner, what would you do with them? What would you say? It’s a game about
               the transformative, transcendent power of queer love, and is dedicated to
               every queer I’ve loved, no matter how briefly, or for how long." <br />

               Your sFace or Mine? Anonymity is centered on the enigma we call identity.
               The upgrade gooses the interactivity-presentation by having the lead
               activation (mouse/touch-over) hotspot run an animation of all the choices
               within that respective grid. A complete and unique mix of animated and
               static "parts" awaits the viewer's input. A slideshow and a short music
               video demonstrate some of the possibilities.
               <br /><br />
               What has come to even more focus - as the "parts" become even more
               transient - is that, while the core of the work is centered on identity,
               what remains throughout all the technological change and innovation is
               prejudice. And while these advancements take us a few steps forward to
               disarm such bias, it still requires us to embrace the differences to make a
               difference.

               Eryk Salvaggio's "Absolut Net.Art" project distills the personal stylistic
               tropes of a handful of standout net.art stars, effectively emulating their
               work through the template of absolut vodka advertisements. The project
               underlines the ease of style hijacking inherent in the digital realm.

               La Sección Amarilla de la Migración is a transnational project conceived by
               Minerva Cuevas in collaboration with the Rubin Center at the University of
               Texas-El Paso. It aims to serve as both a practical and cultural guide for
               migrants navigating the US-Mexico border, framing migration as a natural
               phenomenon that connects humans and non-human species through their shared
               movement across ecosystems.
               <br /><br />
               At the heart of the project is a bilingual, two-hundred-page publication,
               developed through an open call for contributions from artists, writers,
               activists, and organizations on both sides of the border. The book puts
               together a mixture of visual and literary art alongside practical
               resources, providing solidarity, guidance, and comfort for migrants in
               transit serving as both a cultural intervention and a practical resource.
               Distributed for free at key locations across the Americas and online, the
               publication seeks to build a sense of community while offering travelers
               essential information and a cultural connection to the ecosystems they move
               through.
               <br /><br />
               This project places at the forefront of the conversation the necessity of
               recognizing migration as part of broader social and environmental systems,
               inviting ongoing dialogue between regional and international contributors.
               The project emerges as a form of resisting the artificial borders imposed
               by human policies. It acknowledges that borders are continually redefined
               by natural forces, with the Chihuahua desert symbolizing a place where
               human-imposed divisions are reshaped by the movements of both human and
               non-human life seeking survival.

         <li>
            Interactivity and Participation
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Early internet art required the viewer to become a participant, often
                  transforming passive browsing into active engagement. Works were rarely
                  static; they were designed to be clicked, manipulated, or altered by the
                  user, making the audience a part of the creative process.

         <li>
            Immateriality and Virtual Existence
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Unlike traditional art, early internet art often existed only in the
                  digital realm, defying physicality and traditional gallery structures.
                  It lived as code on servers, HTML, and browser windows, emphasizing a
                  "non-object" or ephemeral quality.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>
            Networkability and Connectivity
            <ul>
               <li>
                  The art was often distributed and social, relying on email lists, web
                  browsers, and hyperlinks to create a "networked" experience. This
                  enabled global reach and fostered collaboration, as seen in projects
                  shared across distributed, international communities.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>
            Use of "Web 1.0" Aesthetics and Code
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Artists often used the raw tools of the early internet—basic HTML code,
                  browser frames, glitch aesthetics, and early graphic user interfaces—as
                  their medium. Examples include the chaotic, anti-aesthetic, and
                  deconstructive work of collective JODI, which treated code and error
                  messages as art.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>

         <li>
            Subversion of Institutions and Commercialism
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Early internet art often held a "utopian," democratic ethos, aiming to
                  bypass traditional art galleries, museums, and market structures. It was
                  often created by enthusiasts and artists operating outside conventional
                  commercial art systems.
